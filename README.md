# Hello, this is one of my first usages of git/github.


# Also, this is text I added through VS code. Additionally, I did this by pulling (cloning the remote repository) from my local machine. 
# Then, I made all the necessary changes from my local machine. Then "add", "commit", and "push" all my work (Note to push I had to do extra authenticaltion speciifcally SSS, Secure Shell).
